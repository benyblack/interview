# Queue
- Acess: O(n)
- Search: O(n)
- Insert: O(1) 
- Delete: O(1)
- Space: O(n)

**Queue** is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to **Stacks**. Unlike **Stacks**, a **Queue** is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). **Queue** follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.A real-world example of **Queue** can be a single-lane one-way road, where the vehicle enters first, exits first. More real-world examples can be seen as **Queues** at the ticket windows and bus-stops.
A good example for importance of **Queue** is its usage in [BSF](BSF.md) algorithm.
