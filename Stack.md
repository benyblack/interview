# Stack
- Acess: O(n)
- Search: O(n)
- Insert: O(1) 
- Delete: O(1)
- Space: O(n)

A **Stack** is a basic data structure that can be logically thought as linear structure represented by a real physical **Stack** or pile, a structure where insertion and deletion of items takes place at one end called top of the **Stack**. The basic concept can be illustrated by thinking of your data set as a **Stack** of plates or books where you can only take the top item off the **Stack** in order to remove things from it. This structure is used all throughout programming.
The basic implementation of a **Stack** is also called a LIFO (Last In First Out) to demonstrate the way it accesses data, since as we will see there are various variations of **Stack** implementations.

A good example for importance of ****Stack**** is its usage in [DSF](DSF.md) algorithm (Backtracking).
